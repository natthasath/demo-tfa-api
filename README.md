# ðŸŽ‰ Demo TFA API

TFA (Two-Factor Authentication) is a security measure that requires users to provide two forms of identification in order to access an account or system. This can include a password and a fingerprint, or a password and a text message code. It adds an extra layer of security to protect against unauthorized access.
